# What is Parsek?
Parsek is a core platform designed for back-end applications, allowing developers to focus on their projects without worrying about speed optimizations, best practices, or scalability.

By offering reusable plugins and rapid development tools, Parsek eliminates the need to write the same feature code for each project, ensuring faster, more efficient development while maintaining high performance.

## Philosophy

### Where it came from?
The name "Parsek" is inspired by "parcels" reflecting its modular nature. Just like parcels, Parsek is designed to break down functionality into reusable, interchangeable modules, making it easy to extend and adapt for different back-end applications.

### Why it exists? (Parsek)
Parsek was created to address the common challenges of traditional back-end development, where repetitive features, declining performance, and maintenance difficulties become issues over time. It also aims to overcome the limitations of other back-end frameworks by offering a modular, high-performance, and easily maintainable solution.
